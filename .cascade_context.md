# Market Forecast App: Integration Test Import & Schema Fix (Context Summary)

**Session Date:** 2025-07-22

## Objective
Fix all integration test import errors and database schema issues so that the integration test suite runs successfully, with correct environment-specific table prefixes (`intg_`) and no import or collection errors.

## Main Achievements
- All critical import errors in integration tests have been resolved:
  - `db.test_db_base` and `db.test_db_manager` imports now work by copying relevant files into `intg_tests/db/` and ensuring package structure with `__init__.py`.
  - The persistent `ModuleNotFoundError` for `secmaster.daily_polygon` was fixed by updating the import in `intg_tests/universe/test_universe_daily_prices_polygon.py` to `from src.secmaster.daily_polygon import ...`.
- Integration test suite now runs and collects all tests (50 total), with no import or collection errors.
- The environment is configured to always use Python 3.10 and `PYTHONPATH=src:$(pwd)` for all test runs.

## Remaining Issues
- Several integration tests are still failing, but these failures are now due to test logic, data isolation, fixture loading, assertion errors, or schema/data mismatchesâ€”not import errors.
- Next steps are to systematically address these remaining test failures.

## Technical Details
- All integration test imports are standardized and compatible with the current PYTHONPATH.
- Integration DB schema has been updated to ensure all required tables and columns exist with the correct `intg_` prefix.
- Test suite is run with:
  ```bash
  PYTHONPATH=src:$(pwd) pytest intg_tests --maxfail=20 --disable-warnings -v
  ```
- User preferences: Always use Python 3.10, always set PYTHONPATH as above, always add/update tests for any code changes, and proactively run pytest after modifications.

## Next Steps
- Investigate and fix remaining integration test failures (data isolation, fixtures, assertions, schema/data mismatches).
- Continue to ensure all changes are covered by tests and that the full suite passes before finalizing.
